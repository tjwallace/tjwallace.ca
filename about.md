I'm Jeff Wallace, a Software Engineer based out of Vancouver, Canada.
In 2009 I graduated from [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/) with a degree in Software Engineering.

When I'm not working on my computer, I'm probably out [biking, skiing or hiking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/102059).
I race road bikes for the [Glotman Simpson Cycling team](http://www.glotmansimpsoncycling.ca/) in category 2.
I also enjoy mountain biking on the [North Shore](https://www.trailforks.com/region/north-shore/) and all over the Pacific North West.
In the winter I ride at the [Burnaby Velodrome](http://www.burnabyvelodrome.ca/) and ski at [Whistler Blackcomb](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/).
