To make [a long story short](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/troubled-travel-startup-zozi-gets-acquired-by-peek/), I now find myself with a lot more free time, and I thought I'd used _some_ of it to research and experiment with technologies I haven't had a chance to try yet. While doing this I figured it would also be great to setup a blog and record what I've done. So here is my attempt!

The blog is setup using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). The theme is based on [Kiko Plus](https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus).

A list of the technologies I'd like to play around with:

* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)
  * Server side: [graphql-ruby](https://rmosolgo.github.io/graphql-ruby/), [graphql-batch](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-batch)
  * Client side: [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay), [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/)
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
  * [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form), [revalidate](https://github.com/jfairbank/revalidate)
* Wherever else the JS ecosystem rabbit hole takes me
